= Version history =

 * 1.0.0 (r12)
   * Initial check-in
 * 1.0.1 (r29)
   * FieldMapping intrusive pointers were not thread safe. Fixed. Also fixed reference count in copy constructor.
   * BuildSupport.py - bug fix for dealing with math header file
   * Changed required boost version to 1.34.0
 * 1.1.1 (r35)
   * Renamed Log -> Msg
   * Merged the various class factories into ClassFactory (issue #4)
   * Replaced str() function with explicit boost::lexical_cast<> calls.
   * Added more Imath typedefs.
   * Implemented block cache for SparseField (issue #2)
   * Added base class for reference counted objects (issue #5)
   * FieldMapping: Added voxelToWorld that takes iterators.
   * Renamed LinearFieldInterp/CubicFieldInterp template to LinearGenericFieldInterp/CubicGenericFieldInterp
     * Uses the code from LinearDenseFieldInterp
   * Each concrete Field class now has LinearInterp and CubicInterp typedefs for easy access.
   * Added dataTypeToEnum traits function
   * Version handling in file reading code. Field3D can now specify a minimum version number that the library is compatible with.
