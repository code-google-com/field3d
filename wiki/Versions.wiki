#summary Version history

= Version history =

 * 1.1.6 (rXX)
   * Added 'f3dinfo' app
   * Moved some of the little test apps from apps/ into test/misc_tests and apps/sample_code
   * Field3DFile.cpp : parsePartition() will now skip "field3d_global_metadata". This is to ensure that .f3d files written using v1.2 of the library will be readable by v1.1.6. (issue #19)
 * 1.1.5 (r63)
   * CMake file added (contributed by Nicholas Yue)
   * Removed unused member variables in SparseField (issue #24)
   * BuildSupport.py: addField3DInstall now prepends paths to make sure they take precedence over any installed versions.
 * 1.1.4 (r41)
   * Exposing some utility methods in SparseField (issue #12)
 * 1.1.3 (r40)
   * Commenting and cleanup of SparseFile.h (issue #11)
 * 1.1.2 (r38)
   * Removed some spurious SPI:: namespaces that had snuck in with the SparseFileManager
 * 1.1.1 (r35)
   * Renamed Log -> Msg
   * Merged the various class factories into ClassFactory (issue #4)
   * Replaced str() function with explicit boost::lexical_cast<> calls.
   * Added more Imath typedefs.
   * Implemented block cache for SparseField (issue #2)
   * Added base class for reference counted objects (issue #5)
   * FieldMapping: Added voxelToWorld that takes iterators.
   * Renamed LinearFieldInterp/CubicFieldInterp template to LinearGenericFieldInterp/CubicGenericFieldInterp
     * Uses the code from LinearDenseFieldInterp
   * Each concrete Field class now has LinearInterp and CubicInterp typedefs for easy access.
   * Added dataTypeToEnum traits function
   * Version handling in file reading code. Field3D can now specify a minimum version number that the library is compatible with.
 * 1.0.1 (r29)
   * FieldMapping intrusive pointers were not thread safe. Fixed. Also fixed reference count in copy constructor.
