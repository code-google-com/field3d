= General information =

Field3D was originally developed under CentOS. It has also been tested under MacOS X Leopard.

By default, Field3D will look in your platform's standard directories for include files and libraries. If your libraries reside elsewhere, refer to the "Customizing the build environment" section below.

If you are compiling on an untested platform, you may need to extend the "systemIncludePaths" and "systemLibPaths" dictionaries in the file called _!BuildSupport.py_.

= Building the Field3D library =

To build Field3D, go to the root directory and type `scons`. This will build a shared and a static library and place them in the _install_ folder. By default an optimized/release build is created.

To build a debug version, type `scons debug=1`.

To build a 64-bit version, type `scons do64=1`.

= Customizing the build environment =

Field3D will look in your platform's standard directories for include files and libraries. If you need to add further library paths, include paths etc., add a "Site.py" file in the root directory. The file ExampleSite.py can be used for reference.

= Using a custom math library =

The "Site.py" file can be used to change the math library used by Field3D. The only current requirement is that the other library is syntactically equivalent to Imath. At Sony Imageworks, the Imath library is wrapped in an "SPI" namespace - the _!ExampleSite.py_ and _!SpiMathLib.h_ files shows an example of how to configure it.
